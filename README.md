Marlin Configuration files for a Bigtreetech Gtr V1.0 board
The config files are setup to run a Gtr V1.0 on a Davinci XYZ printer
Original Heatbed is used but the Hotend is a custom setup so i can use normal nozzles/heaters etc.
The chances of anyone having the same setup is slim to none but ive put these files here just in case
Ive also put tehse files here in case my computer goes dead and i can at least recover these files for myself
